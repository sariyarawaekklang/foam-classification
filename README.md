## Description

In this challenge, I attempted to create a foaming classification system. The purpose of this system is for users to be able to view some images and tag them as foaming or not.

## User Story

- As a user, I need to be able to view images from the reactor run.
- As a user, while viewing images I need the ability to mark them as foaming or not.
- As a user, I want my decisions to be stored for the next time I use the app.
- As a user, I need to be able to filter by foaming, non-foaming, and unclassified images.

## Installation

This project was created with the following:

- MongoDB
- Express
- React
- Node
- Bootstrap

## Tests

How to test this application:

- Enter the `client` directory via the command line
- Enter `npm start` to display the React app
